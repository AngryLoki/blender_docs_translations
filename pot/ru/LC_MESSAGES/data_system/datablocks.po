"The base unit for any blender project is the data-block. Examples of data-"
"blocks include: meshes, objects, materials and textures. Be it a simple "
"sphere floating over a plane, or a full featured film, a project is defined "
"by the data-blocks it contains, the properties set for those data-blocks, "
"and the way the data-blocks link to each other. Datablocks can reside within"
" as many ``.blend`` files as needed for good project organization."

"To copy a *Scene* data-block, use *Scene* list found in the header of *User "
"Preferences* window. The list is to the right of the menus and window "
"workspace list. Select *ADD NEW* to make a copy of the current scene. Select"

"Instead of copying **everything**, you can link data-blocks by selecting "
"*Link Objects*, to use the same *Object* data-blocks linked into the two "
"scenes, or *Link ObData*, to create separated objects sharing the same "
"*ObData* data-blocks (meshes, curves, materials, etc.). Note that if you "
"select *Link Objects*, in fact you copy nearly nothing, as *Object* data-"
"blocks are parent of all *ObData* data-blocks: nearly all modifications "
"(object location, mesh geometry, ...) in a scene will be reflected in the "
"other ones linked this way as well. As for *Link ObData*, it creates a "
"\"real\" copy of the objects, but not of their child datalocks: the "
"locations, scales and rotations of the objects will be specific to a scene, "
"but neither their forms nor their materials, textures, ..., will be (as "
"defined by *ObData* data-blocks)."

"A data-block can become unlinked. For example a material data-block will be "
"unlinked if the object it was linked to is deleted. If a data-block is "
"unlinked, by default it will be deleted from the ``.blend`` file when "
"Blender is closed. To keep an unlinked data-block in a .blend file, click "
"the \"F\" button to the right of the object's name in the Objects and Links "
"panel."
