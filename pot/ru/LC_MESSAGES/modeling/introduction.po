"The creation of a 3D scene needs at least three key components: Models, "
"Materials and Lights. In this part, we will delve deeper into the creation "
"of the first of these: modeling. Modeling is the art and science of creating"
" a surface that either mimics the shape of a real-world object or expresses "
"your imagination of abstract objects."

"There are three primary types of modeling - mesh modeling, curve/surface "
"modeling, and meta modeling."

"Mesh modeling typically begins with a primitive shape (e.g. circle, cube, "
"cylinder...). This :doc:`Mesh Primitive </modeling/meshes/primitives>` is "
"defined by an array of points in 3D space called vertices (singular form is "
":term:`Vertex`). From there you might begin extruding faces and moving "
"vertices to create a larger, more complex shape."

":doc:`Curve modeling</modeling/curves/index>` uses control points to define "
"the shape of the curve."

":doc:`Surface modeling</modeling/surfaces/index>` is similar to curve "
"modeling, but instead of being limited to simple linear paths, they allow "
"the creation of three dimensional surfaces, potentially with volume."

msgstr ""

#: ..\..\manual\modeling\introduction.rst:33
msgid ""
"Metaball modeling begins similarly to mesh modeling, with a base shape like "
"a cube or sphere, but instead of extruding these base shapes, these objects "
"are clumped together to form a larger object. In order to accomplish this, "
"the metaballs have a liquid-like quality, when two or more are brought "
"together they merge by smoothly rounding out the point of connection, "
"appearing as one unified object."

"This is one of the quickest ways to get started roughly modeling an object. "
"The resulting figure can then be converted into a mesh for further detailing"
" using :kbd:`Alt-C`."

"Inserting text is quite common for the creation of logos, and can be seen as"
" a special case of neither curve nor mesh modeling. You may define the text,"
" font, bevel, extruded width and several other parameters that control "
"generated object."

msgid ""
"Since Blender functionality is extensible via Python scripting, there are a "
"number of very useful scripts that assist you in modeling. They may give you"
" new mesh primitives to work with, or apply some fancy manipulation of the "
"meshes that you are already working with."

"Modeling scripts are generally more advanced, but also less frequently used "
"programmatic effects that can be a huge time saver in certain cases."

"The included :doc:`spin </modeling/meshes/editing/duplicating/spin>` and "
":doc:`screw </modeling/meshes/editing/duplicating/screw>` functions are "
"examples of a modeling scripts that might otherwise take significantly more "
"work to replicate by hand through mesh or curve modeling."
