"Scenes are a very useful tool for managing your projects. The Cube model in "
"empty space you see when you open Blender for the first time is the default "
"scene. You can imagine scenes to be similar to tabs in your web browser. For"
" example, your web browser can have many tabs open at once. The tabs could "
"be empty, showing identical views of the same web page, showing different "
"views of the same page or show entirely different pages altogether. "
"Blender's scenes work in much the same way. You can have an empty scene, a "
"complete independent copy of your scene or a new copy that links to your "
"original scene in a number of ways."
