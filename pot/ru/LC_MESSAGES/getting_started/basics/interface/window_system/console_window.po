"When Blender carries out operations that require extra memory (RAM), it "

"operation requested by the user. This will most likely result in Blender "
"operating very slowly or shutting down. If you want to avoid running out of "
"memory you can install more memory in your system, reduce the amount of "
"detail in your Blender models, or shut down other programs and services "
"which may be taking up memory that Blender could use."
